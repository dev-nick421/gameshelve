## Why GameShelve?

Self-hosting your game collection shouldn't require a wiki. GameShelve is built to be **boring to run and delightful to use**:

- 🟢 **One file, one command.** A single `docker-compose.yml` and `docker compose up -d`. No database to provision, no message queue, no reverse-proxy gymnastics.
- 📦 **Prebuilt images.** Pull ready-to-run `amd64`/`arm64` images straight from the registry — no build step, works on an Unraid box or a Raspberry Pi alike.
- 🪄 **Sensible defaults.** It just works out of the box; the only thing you _must_ set is a password.
- 🎨 **Enjoyable UI** Cover art, hero pages, screenshots and full IGDB integration, not just a file listing.

> **New to self-hosting?** The [2-minute tutorial](#-get-running-in-2-minutes) below assumes nothing.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Automatic scanning & matching** — drop game folders in, GameShelve finds them and matches metadata via IGDB.
- 🖼️ **A real library** — covers, hero backgrounds, screenshots and accent-coloured detail pages, plus home-page shelves (Recently Added, Most Downloaded, Newest Releases) you can reorder and toggle.
- ✍️ **Custom games** — got something IGDB doesn't know? Pick the folder, add your own art and details, and it's catalogued just like everything else.
- ⬇️ **One-click downloads** — resumable, with friendly filenames and per-game download counts.
- 📡 **Live progress** — scan and compression progress streams to your browser in real time.
- 🔒 **Comprehensive Auditing** — whatever you, the system or the scheduler does, theres a Logs page under settings that never leaves you lost

## 🚀 Get running in 2 minutes

#### Prerequisites

- A machine with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose (Docker Desktop includes both).
- A folder containing your games (a game is either a folder or a .zip file, just drop into your library folder)

#### 1. Grab the compose file and config

```bash
mkdir gameshelve && cd gameshelve
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-nick421/gameshelve/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-nick421/gameshelve/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 2. Edit `.env` — set two things

```ini
ADMIN_PASSWORD=pick-a-strong-password   # required: protects the admin area
LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/games        # the folder containing your games (a game is either a folder or a .zip file)
```

#### 3. Start it

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser. (Change the port with `WEB_PORT` if 8080 is taken.)

#### First-run walkthrough

1. Click **Login** (top right) and sign in with your `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
2. Go to **Settings → IGDB** and paste your free [IGDB API credentials](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) —> needed to fetch cover art and metadata.
3. Go to **Settings → Paths**, add your library path (`/games` will be your `LIBRARY_PATH` inside the container), and save.
4. Open the **Scan** dashboard and hit **Scan Library**. Watch the progress roll in.
5. Head back to the **Library** and enjoy your collection. 🎉

> **Updating:** `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Your data lives in a
> Docker volume, so it survives upgrades. Pin a version with `IMAGE_TAG=v1.0.0` in `.env`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything is configured through `.env` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)):

| Variable                                | Required | Default   | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | :------: | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`                        |    ✅    | —         | Password for the admin area. The app won't start without a non-default value. |
| `LIBRARY_PATH`                          |    ✅    | `./games` | Host folder mounted as your game library.                                     |
| `WEB_PORT`                              |          | `8080`    | Host port for the web UI.                                                     |
| `IMAGE_TAG`                             |          | `latest`  | Pin a specific release, e.g. `v1.0.0`.                                        |
| `MATCH_THRESHOLD`                       |          | `0.6`     | IGDB auto-match confidence (0–1); below this, games are left _Unmatched_.     |
| `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` / `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` |          | —         | Optional; can also be entered in the UI after first run.                      |

The API runs only inside the Docker network — nginx in the web container proxies
`/api` and `/ws` to it, so there's no extra port to expose or secure.

## 🗺️ How it works

1. **Scan** — finds folders/zips in your library and queues them.
2. **Match** — IGDB auto-match; uncertain results become correctable _Unmatched_ games instead of bad data.
3. **Fetch** — downloads metadata, cover, background and screenshots; extracts accent colours for the hero gradient.
4. **Compress** — streams the game into `data/<name>.zip` inside its own folder; the original is removed only after success.
5. **Browse & download** — grid and detail views, with resumable downloads.

Each game lives in its own folder named from the configurable scheme (default
`<Game Name> - <Release Year> [<IGDB_ID>]`), with `data/` for the archive and
`artwork/` for images. Display names are generated at read time, so renaming the
scheme never moves a file.

## 🧑‍💻 Local development

```bash
# API → http://localhost:3000
cd api && npm install && npm run dev

# Web → http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api and /ws to the API)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Run the tests:

```bash
cd api && npm test    # API integration, scanner, IGDB seams
cd web && npm test    # Vue components + stores
```

Build the images yourself:

```bash
docker build -t gameshelve-api ./api
docker build -t gameshelve-web ./web
```

## 📦 Releases

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds multi-arch (`amd64` + `arm64`) images, publishes
them to `ghcr.io/<owner>/gameshelve-{api,web}`, and cuts a GitHub Release.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🙌 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Run `npm test` in both `api/` and `web/`
before opening a PR, and keep changes focused.
